## Hi there üëã

# üí´ About Me:
With a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience as an Application Developer, I specialize in developing and maintaining scalable web applications using Angular and Java Spring Boot. At the State of Michigan DTMB, I have contributed to modernizing digital infrastructure as part of the Agency Service System Retirement (ASSR) office, where we are transitioning a decade-old legacy system to modern technologies. This initiative focuses on Human-Centered Design (HCD), creating seamless processes, and ensuring smooth operations, while also maintaining and supporting existing legacy systems. Experienced in working with Git for version control, Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines, and collaborating across multiple cross-functional teams, I ensure efficient development workflows and high-quality deliverables. Passionate about leveraging emerging technologies, I strive to enhance system performance, security, and user experience while adhering to industry best practices. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring and experimenting with different technologies, as I believe that life is a continuous learning curve‚Äîadaptation is key to growth. I have worked with a variety of creative tools like Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere Pro for personal video editing, as well as DaVinci Resolve and Blender for VFX, short films, and animation. Beyond software development, I also delve into AI/ML and data visualization, exploring Python libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch to understand the potential of generative AI. I‚Äôm always eager to learn, innovate, and push the boundaries of technology to create something meaningful.
